                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Between aerospace manufacturing and telecom, we've spent 25 years watching companies struggle with the same problems: data scattered everywhere, reports that take days to pull together, and decisions made on gut feeling instead of facts. We know what broken looks like because we've fixed it at enterprise scale. Now we're bringing that expertise to companies who need it but can't afford a full data team.</p>

                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p class="intro">We start with your source of truth—getting all your data in one place, cleaned up, and actually connected. From there, we build what you need:</p>

                    <h3>KPIs that matter.</h3>
                    <p>Not every metric that could exist, just the ones that help you run the business.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>Executive reporting.</h3>
                    <p>High-level dashboards that show where you stand without digging through spreadsheets.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>Actionable reporting.</h3>
                    <p>The day-to-day stuff your teams actually use—what's at risk, what needs attention, what's on track.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>Branded documents.</h3>
                    <p>Your reports and dashboards match your company's look, so everything from internal meetings to client updates feels cohesive and professional.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="outro">And when we're done, you're not stuck calling us every time something breaks. We document everything so you (or your future hire) can actually maintain it.</p>
